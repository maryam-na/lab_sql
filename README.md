Instructions
Write queries to answer the following questions:

Write a query to find what is the total business done by each store.
Convert the previous query into a stored procedure.
Convert the previous query into a stored procedure that takes the input for store_id and displays the total sales for that store.
Update the previous query. Declare a variable total_sales_value of float type, that will store the returned result (of the total sales amount for the store). Call the stored procedure and print the results.
In the previous query, add another variable flag. If the total sales value for the store is over 30.000, then label it as green_flag, otherwise label is as red_flag. Update the stored procedure that takes an input as the store_id and returns total sales value for that store and flag value.
